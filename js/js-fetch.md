## Asynchronous Code

Asynchronous code is code that runs in the background. This is useful for tasks that can take a long
time to complete, but don't need to block the main thread.

JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one thing can happen at a time.

Blocking the main thread is bad because it prevents the user from interacting with the page because
no other JavaScript code can be executed. Examples of asynchronous code include: network requests,
file system access, animations and timers.

## Promises

Aynchronous functions will not return their return a value directly, but a promise instead.
A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous
operation, and its resulting value. Most of the time it is returned by a function that performs an
asynchronous operation.
There are two main ways of handling asynchronous Functions: Working with promises or working with `async/await`.

## Asynchronous Code with Promises

You can use the `then` method with a callback function to react to the completion of the asynchronous operation.

```js
asynchronousFunction().then((value) => {
  console.log(value);
});
```

> ðŸ’¡ Promises are almost always created for you by other asynchronous APIs, only rarely do you
> create them yourself. If you create a Promise yourself (`new Promise()`), you either know exactly
> what you are doing, or you are probably doing something wrong.

## Asynchronous Code with `async/await`

Asnyc functions are a syntactic sugar for Promises. Using the `await` keyword, you can write
asynchronous code that looks synchronous. Any function can be prefixed with the `async` keyword:

```js
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  // ...
}

const myAsyncArrowFunction = async () => {
  // ...
};
```

Inside an async function, you can use the `await` keyword to wait for a Promise to be resolved:

```js
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  const value = await otherAsynchronousFunction();
  console.log(value);
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ `async` functions always return a Promise. If the function returns a value, the Promise will be
> resolved with that value. Even if you're not using the `return` keyword the function will return a
> Promise that resolves to `undefined` when it reaches the end of it's scope.

## What is an API?

The term _API_ is short for _Application Programming Interface_.

An _API_ provides a way one software (the _application_) can interact with another software.
Therefore, an application can define a set of features and rules on how other software can interact
with it. This is called an _interface_. Think of a contract between two softwares that explains how
they can work together.

APIs can be seen from different perspectives and occur on various levels.

A browser provides a lot of [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). Each Web
API defines a way on how a JavaScript application can use a feature given by the browser, like:

- [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API)
- [Battery API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API)
- [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

APIs running on a server environment are a different type of API. They are provided by a _server_,
opposing to the APIs provided by the browser (which is also called the _client_). A common use-case
for such APIs is to read / load data. Other operations like writing or deleting data is also
possible. There are common approaches regarding the architecture of a server-side API. One such
approach are REST-APIs, which is explained later in this document.

## Fetch API (with async & await)

`fetch` is a [web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) to asynchronously fetch
(load) resources from the network, like text documents.

```js
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch("/url/to/something");
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

This is what happens in the example above:

1. We mark the function with the `async` keyword, because we want to use `await` inside the
   function.
2. We declare a variable named `response`. It stores the Response object that is returned by
   `fetch`.
3. Once this promise resolves (the network request is finished), we call the `.json` method on the
   `response` variable. This function returns another Promise.
4. This second promise resolves with the actual data (payload) converted from JSON (a formatted
   string) to a JavaScript value or object. This result is stored in the variable named `data`.
5. The function returns the value stored in the `data` variable.

> ðŸ’¡ The `async` and `await` syntax helps with handling the two consecutive promises required to get
> the response data (opposing to the nested syntax using `.then()`)

> ðŸ’¡The `Response` object features other useful methods (all returning promises), among which are
> the following:
>
> - `response.json()` returns a Promise that resolves to the downloaded data JSON-parsed as a
>   JavaScript value or object
> - `response.text()` returns a Promise that resolves to the downloaded data as raw text
> - `response.formData()` returns a Promise that resolves to the downloaded data parsed as FormData
> - `response.blob()` returns a Promise that resolves to the downloaded data as a raw blob (that's a
>   machine readable format using zeros and ones)

## JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data
based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data between a client
(browser) and a server in web applications.

JSON is very close to being a subset of JavaScript syntax. Most valid JSON is also valid JavaScript
code. This means that you can copy JSON into any `.js` file, put a `const myData =` in front, and
watch Prettier make it look like _real_ JavaScript. On the flip side valid JavaScript is not valid
JSON. It looks like this:

```json
{
  "groupName": "Students",
  "groupSize": 100,
  "students": [
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 42,
      "location": "Pleasantville",
      "member": true,
      "groups": ["students", "citizens", "new"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "age": 44,
      "location": "Pleasantville",
      "member": true,
      "groups": ["students", "citizens", "new"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Sam Doe",
      "age": 24,
      "location": "Pleasantville",
      "member": true,
      "groups": ["students", "citizens", "new"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Even though it closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, it can be used outside of
JavaScript. Other programming languages often feature the ability to read (parse) JSON.

JSON exists as a string that needs to be converted to a native JavaScript object when you want to
access the data. No problem! - JavaScript provides a global JSON object that features conversion
methods in either direction.

> ðŸ’¡ JSON Conversion Methods
>
> `JSON.parse()`
>
> This method parses a JSON string and constructs the JavaScript value or object described by the
> string.
>
> `JSON.stringify()`
>
> This methods converts a JavaScript value or object to a JSON string.

## HTTP Response Status Codes

HTTP response status codes usually indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully
completed. For the most part, _any_ sort of response is considered a successful completion of the
request.

With the exception of custom server software, these responses are standardized. You can find a list
of HTTP response status codes [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

One of the most well-known HTTP response status codes is
[`404 not found`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404), which most users of
the web might have already encountered at some point.

> status dogs' (or cats if you like them better).

## REST API

When you create an API, you need to come up with ideas on how to structure your API, shape the
features you provide and which rules to apply. This is referred to as the architecture of your API.

There are different common approaches used across the web. A very popular one is REST API or RESTful
API.

REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. You as an API developer
can implement REST in a variety of ways.

> ðŸ’¡ REST is short for REpresentational State Transfer

The overall idea is like this:

- A _client_ requests a _resource_ from a _server_ (like a document containing information on a
  specific topic)
- The _server_ formulates a response that represents the resource in a format the _client_
  understands (like JSON - other formats like HTML, XML oder plain text are also possible)
- This transfer of data changes the state of the web application.

Each resource has a unique address. The whole communication is done via HTTP and uses different HTTP
methods (like GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to describe desired actions.

> ðŸ’¡ This is a very basic and incomplete explanation. If you're interested in learning more about
> what makes an API RESTful, you can read about it [here](https://restfulapi.net/).
